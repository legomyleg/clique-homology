# clique-homology
Compute Betti numbers and simplicial homology of clique complexes generated from graphs.

# Input
A simple graph $G = (V, E)$ is given as an edge list. A python module could take the edge list and convert it to an edge space $\mathcal{E}(G)$ and vertex space $\mathcal{V}(G)$ represented by matrices. Numpy would be a great tool to use.
